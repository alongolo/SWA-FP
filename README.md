## How to run:
### To run the SWA Tests - 
Run the test cases in the "main.py". 
The test cases calls the function "nested_cross_swa". To run the improved SWA implementation, change the parameter "swa_improved" in this function to "True". 
WARNING: The tests could take a while to run.

### To run the post-hoc tests:
Simply run the "PostHocTest.py" file.
